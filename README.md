This project is the source code for the website of my acapella group (CU Boulder's On the Rocks)! You can go check out the website at: https://cuboulderontherocks.com.

I created this website using [React](https://reactjs.org/), a component-based JavaScript library that allowed me to efficiently create this cool single page website! The goal is to eventually make this website have parallax components using the [react-scroll-parallax](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll-parallax) package, but as of now it is a pretty simple single-page scrollable website!

# Packages Used

I used the following packages while creating this website, using the yarn package installer:

1. [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) (obviously)
2. [react-scrollable-anchor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scrollable-anchor)

# Deployment

In order to deploy this website and host it, I used Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) hosting services, which are free!

# Running it on your own

Install the necessary dependencies (yarn, react), and then run the following commands:

```

Run `yarn run build` after creating any changes you want to see in your build!
